# Greedy Optimization
## Simple optimization under constraints"


The code provided explains the `greedy optimization algorithm`. The greedy algorithm performs the allocation of food items to a menu based on various criteria. Let's break down the code.

## Optimization Problem

Each food item has a `nutrition value`, which is good, and a `calorie value`, which should be kept below a limit. The optimization goal of this code is to select a combination of food items from a menu that maximizes the total value while staying within a constraint on the total calorie content.
